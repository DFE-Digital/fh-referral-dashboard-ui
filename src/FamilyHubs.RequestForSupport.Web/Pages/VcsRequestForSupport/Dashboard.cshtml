@* todo: borrow the status box (for accessibility) from the moj component (or perhaps do without the status box?) (see createStatusBox) *@
@* todo: borrow some of the moj js code and sort in the front end if there is only a single page (sort would have to be case insensitive) *@
@* todo: highlight on selected header is slightly too short*@
